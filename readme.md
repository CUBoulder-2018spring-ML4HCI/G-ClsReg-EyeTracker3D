## Project Goals

The goal of our project was to combine regression and classification algorithims into one package and utilize them in order to pinpoint the location of an individual's gaze along
with the general direction they are looking. We then take this data and pipe it into an output system we made using the 3D-modeling tool Blender in order to visualize the 
user's eyes and their movement. 

## Tools and Libraries Used
* [Tobii Eye Tracking](https://www.tobii.com) Bar and associated API - data gathering
* [SharpOSC](https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/SharpOSC) - communication
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - modeling
